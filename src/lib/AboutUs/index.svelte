						developed the first Production Management System (PMS) with app support in the present
						Chinese production market. In the present production process, all the scheduling, list
						of props and customes and calculation of labour are all done traditionally by man-power
						which will use up unnesscessary time and resources, especially in printing materials.
						With the use of our PMS, we aim to improve the production workflow in communication,
						security and information sharing. Our system can safe time, man-power and most
						importantly the cost for production. It also achieve eco friendly purpose. We would like
						to emphasis our PMS is developed by experienced senior television producer and
						programmer. With this being said, it is almost impossible to be replicated or replaced
						by another system. Our strategy is to focus on our functionality and user friendly
						compatibility development in order to stay on top of the market.
